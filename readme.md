## ECDSA Simple Wallet

This project is an example of using a client and server to facilitate transfers between different addresses.

Public Key Cryptography is incorporated so transfers can only be completed with a valid signature.

By using Elliptic Curve Digital Signatures we can make it so the server only allows transfers that have been signed for by the person who owns the associated address.

`secp256k1` elliptic curve from `js-ethereum-cryptography` has been used specifically in this project, the signature is generated by hashing the transferer's private key with a message that consists the transaction data and timestamp to avoid scenarios like an interception of signature from malicious attackers.

### Client

The client folder contains a [react app](https://reactjs.org/) using [vite](https://vitejs.dev/). To get started, follow these steps:

1. Open up a terminal in the `/client` folder
2. Run `npm install` to install all the depedencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the application
4. Now you should be able to visit the app at http://127.0.0.1:5173/

### Server

The server folder contains a node.js server using [express](https://expressjs.com/). To run the server, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal within the `/server` folder
2. Run `npm install` to install all the depedencies
3. Run `node index` to start the server
4. The application should connect to the default server port (3042) automatically

### To be improved

Security concern when generating the signature - Users should be connecting to wallets like MetaMask and sign the transaction without ever exposing their private key to the client and server.
